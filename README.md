# YannikG.PageableData
A small package that helps you work with pageable data in your dotnet application.

## Motivation
This package was created when switching back from using Java Spring Boot in my daily work. I missed the easy-to-use paging and built my own. This package is lightweight and easy to extend. I used an identical implementation in many of my projects and decided to unify all into this package.
